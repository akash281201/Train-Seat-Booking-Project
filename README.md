simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
- One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
- If a person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
- If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby
seats are booked.
- User can book as many tickets as s/he wants until the coach is full.
